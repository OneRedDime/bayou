with quickly developing a game utilizing 2D graphics.

## What's contained
This repo contains the Bayou core files along with just enough to illustrate
how to use them in a simple game. The game you will build allows you to see how
the menus work in Bayou, and allows you to run around in an arena with a
central invisible wall and elf chasing you around.
